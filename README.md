# Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
The Vulnerability Scanner is a tool designed to scan websites for common security vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection. It sends HTTP requests to the target domain with predefined payloads to detect potential vulnerabilities.

## Features
- Detection of XSS vulnerabilities using various payloads
- Detection of CSRF vulnerabilities using crafted HTML forms and payloads
- Detection of SQL injection vulnerabilities using SQL payloads

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheDarkKnightLives/neo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the script `scanner.py`:
   ```bash
   python scanner.py
   ```
2. Enter the domain name (e.g., example.com) when prompted.
3. The script will scan the specified domain for XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection vulnerabilities and display the results.
